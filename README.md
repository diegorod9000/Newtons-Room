# Newtons-Room
This is my project for MIT course 11.127. Setting up requires python and pygame to be installed.

# Controls
esc - ends the game (and also crashes it)
A - go to previous level
D - skip to next level
Space - cycles between setup and movement state
## Normal levels
click - places an arrow (direction is dependant on arrow buttons)
up/down - allows the player to place vertical arrows
left/right - allows the player to place horizontal arrows
